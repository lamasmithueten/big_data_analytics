	abstract = {Voluminous amounts of data have been produced, since the past decade as the miniaturization of Internet of things ({IoT}) devices increases. However, such data are not useful without analytic power. Numerous big data, {IoT}, and analytics solutions have enabled people to obtain valuable insight into large data generated by {IoT} devices. However, these solutions are still in their infancy, and the domain lacks a comprehensive survey. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art research efforts directed toward big {IoT} data analytics. The relationship between big data analytics and {IoT} is explained. Moreover, this paper adds value by proposing a new architecture for big {IoT} data analytics. Furthermore, big {IoT} data analytic types, methods, and technologies for big data mining are discussed. Numerous notable use cases are also presented. Several opportunities brought by data analytics in {IoT} paradigm are then discussed. Finally, open research challenges, such as privacy, big data mining, visualization, and integration, are presented as future research directions.},
